# [HiQGA.jl](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/HiQGA.jl) workshop at ASEG Discover 2024 conference, Hobart: Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) surveying from farm to table -- an interactive overview of acquisition, processing and inversion of AEM data

Jupyter notebooks are in the directory 
```
00_notebooks/
``` 
and will only require the use of a computer with at least 7 CPUs. Most laptops can run these in 2024. Remember to change any file paths to your local disk if running the notebooks yourself. 

**To view the pre-run notebooks with results, simply click the `.ipynb` file in GitHub on your browser.**

Julia scripts (not notebooks) on which the notebooks are based, are in the directories

```
synthetic/  
UDF_data/  
UDF_deterministic/  
UDF_probabilistic/  
```

Simply run within Julia, or an IDE like Julia/VSCode, the files in numbered order for `synthetic/`. Remember to change any file paths to your local disk!

Please note that the `UDF_deterministic/` and `UDF_probabilistic/` directories use MPI and 1,000s of cores. The `submit.sh` scripts for `qsub`/PBS on the Gadi cluster, as well as diagnostic output from HiQGA is included in these directories. These two directories only require you run within Julia, the 01, 02 and 04 scripts to plot pre-run results. However, for the probabilistic inversions, the full posteriors are too large to provide here. Again, remember to change any file paths to your local disk.

The directory
```
viz
```
contains a Julia script that uses the accompanying [RDP.jl](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/HiQGA.jl/blob/55400fa97c57f576701e239e651ccce83557cf46/zz_portalcurtains/RDP.jl) module in commit `55400fa` for [VTK](https://vtk.org/) visualization in [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) or another VTK viewer such as [VisIt](https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/).  

## Installation of HiQGA version used in the workshop
To install the workshop stable release, use Julia's `Pkg` REPL by hitting `]` to enter `pkg>` mode. Then enter the following, at the `pkg>` prompt:
```
pkg> add HiQGA @0.4.13 
```
This version of the workshop works for HiQGA versions 0.4.9 to 0.4.13. The *exact* version used in the workshop was `0.4.9`.
