# An example of adding a Python forward to HiQGA
Follows the `examples/Bar` schema if you don't want to modify HiQGA but want to use it for your own forward problem, written in Python. This uses the [disba](https://pypi.org/project/disba/) package and the Julia-Python interop package [PythonCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PythonCall.jl). Make sure **disba** is installed in your python environment. `./src` contains the Julia wrappers `./forward examples` has Julia forward examples with and without the wrappers. `./synthetic` has full fledged Julia synthetics with **disba error handling** when roots are not found in the python dispersion modelling.
